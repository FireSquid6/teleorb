# Teleorb
Teleorb is a 2D precision platformer/metroidvania currently being developed in Godot. FireSquid6 is the primary solo developer, however help would be greatly appreciated. 

# Controls
**These are subject to change as the project grows. Ideally a menu is created for changing them and controller support is added.**
WASD - move  
Space - Jump  
Left Click - throw orb  
Shift - hold wall  

# Contributing
Each "issue" in the issue tab represents a task that needs to be done. If it's your first time, look for issues marked with the tag "good first issue." You can just branch off of "main" to work on the issue. Make sure to pull frequently so no conflicts arrise on main.
