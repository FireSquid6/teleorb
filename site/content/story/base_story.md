## Overview
Teleorb is not a primarily narrative driven game. The story serves as a background as a secondary "B" plot to the main appeal of the game, that being 
its mechanics. This means that the story should have:
- Very little dialogue
- Symbolism and themes through gameplay
- Player remains in control

## Plot
The story follows an unnamed student who is transported to and explores the cave world.  
  
At the start of the game, a cutscene plays where this student is seen bored of the monotony of class. The screen turns to black with the text "Monotony" written on it. The screen moves back to the scene of the classroom after a few seconds, where a portal opens up beneath the student to the caves. The scene shifts to the starting room, with the student falling from the ceiling. They pick up and put on a nearby hard hat, before giving up control to the player.    
  
After this scene, the player does not lose control of the player until the end of the game.  
  
The player continues until at the end of the first series of rooms, they are greeted with a room that blurs into the janitorial closet seen at their school. In the middle of the room is a podium with some sort of item on it. Once the player picks up this orb, a portal opens up to the next level.  
  
Occasionally, the player will be transported to a special wormhole dimension where they are chased by their darkness. This forces them to play through a series of levels quickly and under extreme pressure and panic before being able to get back to the caves.

This series of events repeats itself for a few levels, with the player unlocking a new ability each level, until using all of their collected abilities as "keys" to get to a final portal that takes them back to the real world.  
  
After being transported back to reality, the player is seen in their house. Their movement is not the same as it was in the caves, with realistic jump height and no walljumps. The player moves into their room where they attempt to pick up a knife, but are transported back into a variation of the caves.  
  
In this new version of the caves, a dark path is seen on the left and a light path to the right. The dark path takes the player through a series of easy and arguably monotonous rooms. Upon reaching a portal at the end of this, the player picks up the knife and commits suicide before the screen fades to red and the text "I can't take this anymore" appears. On the other hand, the light path takes the player through a series of brutally hard rooms. Each time the player dies, they are given the prompt "Would you like to give up?" If the player selects yes, they will be put on the dark path with no way to go back. At the end of this, a final darkness chase occurs before the end is reached. In the end scene of the light level, the player destroys the knife before the screen fades into white, signifying victory.
